# Dzennik BFG Edition
There is an app for Belorussian e-diary "schools.by" called Dzennik (Дзённiк). It's uncomfortable and low-feature without payments. Dzennik BFG is a better and 100% free alternative.

# Dependencies
- Sentry
- Fresco
- Fuel
- Fuel-Android, Fuel-Json, Fuel-Corutines

# Building
Honestly, I don't know, how to build this. I just open Android Studio and run it. It seems like you need to sync gradle dependencies before building (*honestly, i don't know, and I'm sorry. I'm just starting my Kotlin developer future. If you know, how to properly make this section, then, please, tell me :) *)

# Note
I've got those APIs from capturing calls from original Dzennik (Дзённiк) app. It doesn't break their ToS, but, you are responsible for your account at schools.by anyway.
